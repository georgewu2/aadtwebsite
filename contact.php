				<h1>Contact Us</h1>
				<p> To join AADT, simply come to one of our regular weekly warm-ups at 2pm on Sundays in Studio 74 (74 Mount Auburn Street, 3rd floor). During general rehearsal, we lead about two hours of exercises starting with jazz-based strength training, followed by traditional Chinese dance techniques, and ending with hip-hop dance drills. </p>
				<p>As the year progresses, rehearsals are scheduled according to dance by individual choreographers, and dancers choose the number of dances they want to participate in. Generally, each dance will rehearse approximately 2 hours per week, with addtional practices before performances. We have dance space in Studio 74, and also use HDC and house dance studios. </p>
				<p>To find out more about AADT, or to invite/hire us for a performance, please contact the co-captains. </p>
