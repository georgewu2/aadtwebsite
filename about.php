    			<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p align="justify">For over eighteen years, the Harvard Asian American Dance Troupe (AADT) has sought to spread an appreciation and awareness of Asian culture through the medium of dance. Our repertoire includes a diverse range of dance forms including traditional, ethnic minority, martial arts, modern, ballet, hip hop, and fusion. Our pieces are student choreographed/arranged and feature both undergraduate and graduate school students. </p>
					<p align="justify" class="style6">AADT is proud of our non-audition, all welcome policy. In AADT, students of all cultural and dance backgrounds to participate in bringing the variety, skill, and vibrancy of Asian dance to an audience. We hope to encourage interaction and collaboration with other dance groups on campus and make AADT a reflection of Harvard's diverse and creative environment. </p>
    	    <p align="justify">We perform regularly on campus at venues such as <strong>Cultural Rhythms</strong>, <strong>Arts First</strong>, and <strong>Chinese New Year banquets</strong>, and as guests at other concerts. We also seek to reach the Boston community and beyond through benefit, cultural, and educational events. The year's work culminates in hosting our own annual spring production, <strong>Eastbound</strong>.
